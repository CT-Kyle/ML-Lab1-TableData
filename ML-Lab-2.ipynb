    "### Overview\n",
    "This dataset is a collection of artists, songs, and lyrics downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics and scraped from the lyrics website: lyricsfreak.com \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The dataset itself was colelcted for the explicit purpose of data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing. Such as word clustering or predicting artist by song lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance and Usefulness\n",
    "This data is important because we are interested in gathering data about certain words that are used in various songs across genres. We will know if we have gathered useful data by identifying prominent words within the dataset. Since the dataset is comprised of songs across all genres, we want to identify words used across genres. If there are no common words, then we can assume that genre lyrics differ enough to have very few or no commonalities."
